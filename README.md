# GameOverTinction

Welcome to the source code of my little Web-Browser Game called GameOverTinction.

# Project Description

## About

It's a copy-cat from the physical board game **"Nobodey is perfect"**, but just brought for you to the world wide web :blush:

However it's currently at **very beginning of the development process** and therefore just like an helpful extension you can play in combination with the real physical board game.

## Used technologies

It's a node.js web app, using the following technologies

- web framework: [**express.js**](https://expressjs.com/)
- template engine: [**pug**](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)
- database: [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- and many more npm packages :smile:
